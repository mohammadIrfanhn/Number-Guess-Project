# Number-Guess-Project

#Made a project using HTML, CSS and JavaScript
#Used DOM manipulation
#Created a number guessing game where the user has to guess a random number between 1 - 20
#Gave feedback on whether the guess was too high or too low
#If the user guesses correctly it shows a message saying "Congratulations! Otherwise shows that "You lost the game"
